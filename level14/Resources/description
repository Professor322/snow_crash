nothing found 
so i tried to reverse getflag

obdjump -d /bin/getflag to see disasm

found 2 intersting places
first: the one that checks if we are using gdb or ltrace comparison
 0x804898e test $eax $eax // val = -1
ZF was not set
i changed it to 0 (set $eax=0)

than i surpassed the message "do no try to reverse it"

than i set breakpoint right after first getuid:
i found uid in /etc/passwd for flag14 it was 3014

x8048b0a // first cmp 
and eax value here was 2014
i changed it to 3014 (set $eax=3014)
and i got the password: 7QiHafiNa3HVozsaXkawuYrTstxbpABHD8CPnHJ
