lua scripts wait for input password then 
hash the password and compares hashes
it executes from flag11

it uses io.open("some text"..pass.."some text")
where pass is a function argument which we are passing as a password

so we can try to insert getflag as a password and redirect and output
to the file 

like this:

password: "\getflag > /tmp/password"\

here we have our password to level12 without loggin into flag11: fa6v5ateaw21peobuub8ipe6s
